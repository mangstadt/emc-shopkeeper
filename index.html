<p>EMC Shopkeeper is a program that helps you keep track of your in-game shop transactions on the <a href="http://www.empireminecraft.com">Empire Minecraft</a> server.  Find out how many rupees you've made, what items sell the best, and who your best customers are!</p>

<h1><a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FAQ</h1>

<p class="question">What's the difference between the two download options?</p>
<p>The <span class="highlight">auto-runner</span> ensures that you are always running the latest version of EMC Shopkeeper. Every time it launches, it checks for a new version, and downloads it if one is available. But occasionally, the auto-runner file itself ("emc-shopkeeper.jnlp") has to be updated, in which case you'll have to manually download a fresh copy. The downside to using the auto-runner is that it requires additional security rights which some computers block.</p>
<p>The <span class="highlight">full JAR file</span> can be run on any computer. The downside to this is that it does not automatically update like the auto-runner does. If an update is available, EMC Shopkeeper will tell you when it starts up, in which case you will have to download the new JAR file manually.</p>

<p class="question">I clicked on "Auto-Run", but all I see is a bunch of weird text.</p>
<p>This is because the file is being opened by your web browser instead of by Java. Go to "File > Save" and save the file somewhere on your computer. Then, right-click the file and select "Run As > Java" (or some variant thereof).</p>

<p class="question">When I run EMC Shopkeeper, it's warning me that EMC Shopkeeper may harm my computer.  Will it?</p>
<p>EMC Shopkeeper is virus and malware free. It will not harm your computer. But while EMC Shopkeeper is safe, not all JAR files are safe! As always, you should exercise extreme caution when downloading software from the internet.</p>

<p class="question">Why does EMC Shopkeeper need my EMC password?  Will you steal it?</p>
<p>EMC Shopkeeper needs your password into order to logon to your EMC account and download your <a href="http://empireminecraft.com/rupees/transactions">rupee transaction history</a>. Your password is not logged, recorded, or stolen in any way. If you select the "Save password" checkbox when entering your credentials into EMC Shopkeeper, it will save your password to your hard drive.</p>
<p>If you feel unsafe about giving EMC Shopkeeper your password, you can change your password temporarily, and then change it back when you are done using EMC Shopkeeper.</p>

<p class="question">How do I download the transactions of my alt account?</p>
<p>If you have alt accounts and would like to download the transaction histories for them as well, you will need to create separate profiles for them. <span class="highlight">Do NOT simply enter different login credentials at the login prompt when you click the "Update Transactions" button!</span> Each profile is only designed to hold the transactions of a single account.</p>

<p>To load EMC Shopkeeper under a different profile, run the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the "main menu" button in the upper-left corner, point to "Settings", and click "Show Profiles On Startup".<br /><img src="images/faq/show-profiles-on-startup.png" width="300" />
<li>Close EMC Shopkeeper and re-open it.
<li>A profile dialog will appear. Type in the name of your new profile, then click "OK".<br /><img src="images/faq/profile.png" />
</ol>

<p class="question">I'm on a Mac and I can't use the auto-runner!</p>
<p>You may have trouble auto-running the application if you're on a Mac. That's because EMC Shopkeeper is not signed with a certificate from an official certificate authority. In this case, you will need to download the full JAR file instead.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/faq/jnlp.png" /></div>

<p class="question">I'm on a Mac and I can't run the JAR file!</p>
<p>Double-clicking the JAR file may display a security warning, which prevents you from running it.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/faq/mac-security.png" /></div>
<p>To get around this, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on the JAR file.<br />
  <img src="images/faq/mac-rightclick.png" height="300" />
<li>Select "Open" while holding down the "Control" key
<li>Click the "Open" button at the warning dialog.<br />
  <img src="images/faq/mac-security2.png" />
</ol>

<p>You only have to do this once, and then once again every time the file changes (i.e. when you update EMC Shopkeeper).</p>

<p class="question">How do I transfer all my transaction info to another computer?</p>
<p>EMC Shopkeeper stores all of its data in a directory called ".emc-shopkeeper", located in the root of your user directory.  Simply copy this directory to the user directory of the other computer and you're set!  Below is the full path to the directory in each operating system (replace "USERNAME" with your username):</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Windows XP and below</b>: <code>C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\.emc-shopkeeper</code></li>
  <li><b>Windows Vista and above</b>: <code>C:\Users\USERNAME\.emc-shopkeeper</code></li>
  <li><b>Mac OS X</b>: <code>/Users/USERNAME/.emc-shopkeeper</code></li>
  <li><b>Linux</b>: <code>/home/USERNAME/.emc-shopkeeper</code></li>
</ul>
